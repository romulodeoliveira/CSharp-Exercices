/*
Write a program in C# Sharp to implement a method that returns a structure. This includes calling the method and using its value.
Test Data :

Method that returns a structure  :                                               
--------------------------------------                                           
Input the dimensions of the Square( equal length and breadth ) :                 
length : 20                                                                      
breadth : 40                                                                     

Expected Output:

Perimeter and Area of the square :                                               
Length:    20                                                                    
Breadth:    40                                                                   
Perimeter: 120                                                                   
Area:      800
