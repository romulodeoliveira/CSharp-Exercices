/*
Write a C# Sharp Program to add one millisecond and 2.5 milliseconds to a given date value. Display each value and the difference between it and the original value.

Note: The difference is displayed both as a time span and as a number of ticks and one millisecond equals 10,000 ticks.

Expected Output :

Original date: 08/16/2016 04:00:00.0000000 (636,069,600,000,000,000 ticks)
                                                                        
Second date:   08/16/2016 04:00:00.0010000 (636,069,600,000,010,000 ticks)                                                                      
Difference between dates: 00:00:00.0010000 (10,000 ticks)               
                                                                        
Third date:    08/16/2016 04:00:00.0025000 (636,069,600,000,025,000 ticks)                                                                      
Difference between dates: 00:00:00.0025000 (25,000 ticks)
