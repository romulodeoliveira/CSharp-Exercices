Write a C# Sharp program to determine the type of a particular object.

Expected Output :

24 is a 32-bit integer.                                                          
10653 is a 32-bit integer.                                                       
24 is an unsigned byte.                                                          
-5 is a signed byte.                                                             
26.3 is a double-precision floating point.                                       
'string' is another data type.
