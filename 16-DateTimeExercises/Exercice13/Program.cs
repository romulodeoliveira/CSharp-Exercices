Write a C# Sharp Program to add 30 seconds and the number of seconds in one day to a DateTime value.

Note: It displays each new value and displays the difference between it and the original value. The difference is displayed both as a time span and as a number of ticks.

Expected Output :

Original date: 08/15/2016 04:00:00 (636,068,736,000,000,000 ticks)      
                                                                        
Second date:   08/15/2016 04:00:30 (636,068,736,300,000,000 ticks)      
Difference between dates: 00:00:30 (300,000,000 ticks)                  
                                                                        
Third date:    08/16/2016 04:00:00 (636,069,600,000,000,000 ticks)      
Difference between dates: 1.00:00:00 (864,000,000,000 ticks)
