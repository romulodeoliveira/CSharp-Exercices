Write a C# Sharp program to convert the current DateTime object value to its equivalent long date string representation.

Expected Output :

Initialize the DateTime object to May 16, 2016 3:02:15 AM.              
                                                                        
The date and time patterns are defined in the DateTimeFormatInfo        
object associated with the current thread culture.                      
                                                                        
Current culture: "en-US"                                                
                                                                        
Long date pattern: "dddd, MMMM d, yyyy"                                 
Long date string:  "Monday, May 16, 2016"
